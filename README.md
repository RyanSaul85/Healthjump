# Healthjump

### Project Instructions

At Healthjump we develop a lot of API based electronic medical record extracts. This project is designed to have you build a API extract with Python 3 that accesses the Healthjump sandbox and extracts demographics.

Include a cache in your API service as well so users are not fetching the same things over and over.
