# Healthjump

### Project Instructions

At Healthjump we develop a lot of API based electronic medical record extracts. This project is designed to have you build a API extract with Python 3 that accesses the Healthjump sandbox and extracts demographics.

Include a cache in your API service as well so users are not fetching the same things over and over.

### How to run the application

1. Find the URI
2. Use the GET request
3. Include a header
4. Include an API key or access token
5. Wait for the response
6. Find the filtered_list with specific patients
